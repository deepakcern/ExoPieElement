setup_2017_2016_v01: * switched off the CA15 jets,
                     * switched on the AK8 gen jets in jetTree.  
                     * Added new b-jet regression files from Deepak (he took from Twiki) 
                     * added filters for MC 2017

                     * this is essentially same as setup_2017_2016_v01 but it works without error on data also (for gen jet part).
